                        made our pilgrimage to bob’s donuts in sf. while strategizing outside i suggested that we try the buttermilk donuts here, since the guy in front of us was ordered three. kevin said “i thought you swore off them” to which i made a weird grunting noise and just shrugged. maybe donuts, much like dialects and music, develop regional differences. the oakland native bms are bow-shaped and light brown, bob’s bms were a single dark-brown hump with a light sheen of glaze. not as sweet as the others, not as crunchy, but kevin said “this is the first one that actually tastes like buttermilk”.

                        apparently we’re stubborn mfs. got another buttermilk donut here, a chonker like the last one. our blind faith paid off and this time it was actually good. instead of tasting artificially floral it was buttery and smooth. still not tangy like the one from gg, but maybe we should go back and recalibrate our expectations.

                        taken aback by our first bite. we were starting to run out of adjectives to describe and distinguish all the raised glazed donuts we’ve tried from each other. how many synonyms are there for the word fluffy? finally one that tasted different to the others. kind of cake-like. more dense and less ethereal. twice as thick as the usual ones, almost as if they stacked and squashed two of them together. light and buttery nonetheless.

                        were we just dreaming? that first buttermilk donut from gg was revelatory, tangy and rich with a nice crunch. we’ve tried the buttermilk donuts at three different stores since and none of them have come even close to the “maybe the best donut i’ve had yet” (kevin) status of the first one. maybe i’m not being fair, this one was a little better than the other two, it wasn’t as artificial tasting, i thought it tasted rich and rounded like a buttermilk pancake, kevin thought it tasted specifically like ‘rita’s mango water-ice’ (is that a compliment?). i think i’m going to call a moratorium on b-milks until we go back to gg and verify whether we’ve set a false standard.

                        i figured since we biked twice as far as we usually would we should get a few more donuts and try some new things. ended up buying four donuts for the two of us, pretended to exercise restraint by getting a small cinnamon roll instead of a face-sized one. first cinnamon roll we’ve tried, it was pretty good and grew on me the more bites i took. still, i think if you’re going to get a cinnamony donut you might as well get an apple fritter. that being said we haven’t had any twists yet, im holding out hope that a cinnamon twist might be sizeable enough to be fluffy and crunchy, something apple fritters generally are not meant to be.

                        best actual croissant hands down, no wonder the store is called 'donut and croissant'. was a little skimpy on the filling, kevin wasn't pleased to find sausage in only the middle 50% of the sandwich. pretty cheesy at least. he thinks the golden gate sec is still the best, probably because they put two sausage patties in there.

                        i get why chinese oil sticks are also called crullers now since they’re identical in texture. crullers are lighter than the even regular raised donuts. the crumb is elastic and maybe a little rubbery. dough tastes pretty eggy, not sure it’s my favorite type of donut.

                        pretty generous with the apple. waay too much icing sugar glaze on the outside, it pooled into the divots so you could see streaks of white, probably a good way to tell if your fritter will make your teeth hurt. decent flavor though hard to tell through all the sugar.
